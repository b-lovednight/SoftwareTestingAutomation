Code can be analyzed from which a decision table can be created.  From the decision table, statement coverage and decision coverage can be assessed and then a numerical value of how well the software is functional can be computed. 
For security, the code must undergo further analysis and specifically looked at for input sanization as well as looking for any negative practices with exception handling such that not too much information is given out to the public in case of an exception such that threat actors can deduce ways to attack the software. 
User needs are all based on written communication and understanding.  The requirements must be elicited, written down, and then agreed upon with understanding.  If there is any disconnect between the Software Engineers, Non-technical members of the team, and, especially, the client/stakeholder, you could be building in the wrong direction wasting time and money. 
Software design is approached with caution, prudence, and lots of documentation.  The plan must be thoroughly set in place before any cursor touches the IDE.  Pseudocode must be written, diagrams to relationships drawn, and a list of Functional and Non-Functional requirements set such that the Software Engineers know exactly what they are building.

Sometimes I think software development is akin to property developement, such that you never see a compentant builder without a carefully though out floor plan and schematics.
